== Welcome to my Rails 3 Sample Application

This is only an application that I have developed by reading the Book "Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial - Learn Rails by Example" by Michel Hartl.

I heartly thank Michel Hartl and its publisher for all the efforts. While you may read the freeversion of the book online, having a copy of it is certainly worth it.
The video casts supplimentary of this book is available for sale too. I intend to buy it soon, and even personally push for its purchase to our office library.

Hartl advises to use the following tools in your everyday rails development:
- annotate-model gem
- spork
- autotest
- SQLite database browser (cross platform)
I don't have anything else to say.
